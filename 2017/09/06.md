#### Permission Groups
* **u** - owner
* **g** - group
* **o** - others
* **a** - all users

#### Permission Types
* **r** - read
* **w** - write
* **x** - execute

#### Permission Checkout
* `ls -l [<file>] [<dir>]`
    * Example
        * `-rwxr-xr-x   1   root   root   4120 Feb 25 14:08 /etc/sevenhell`
* Means
    * `- | rwx | r-x | r-x`
        * The first character is the special permission flag that can vary.
            * `-`: no special permissions
            * `d`: directory
            * `l`: The file or directory is a symbolic link 
        * The following set of three characters is for the **owner** permissions
        * The second set of three characters is for the **group** permissions
        * The third set of three characters is for the **others** permissions
    * `1`
        * The number of links to the file
    * `root`
        * The first `root` means file owner
    * `root`
        * The second `root` means the group
    * `4120`
        * The file size in bytes
    * `Feb 25 14:08`
        * The date and time refer to the last modification to the file
    * `/etc/sevenhell`
        * The file path and name
    
#### Permission Modify
* Explicitly Defining Permissions
    * Example
        * `-rw-rw-rw- 2 root root 718 Feb 09 14:09 /home/file1`
    * Remove the **read** and **write** permissions form **all users** group
        * `chmod a-rw file1`
    * Add the **execute** permissions form **others**
        * `chmod o+x file1`
* Using Binary References To Set Permissions
    * Permissions Numbers
        * r = 4
        * w = 2
        * x = 1
    * Example
        * `-rw-rw-rw- 2 root root 718 Feb 09 14:09 /home/file1`
    * Set file1 permissions to `-rwxrw-r--`
        * `chmod 764 file1`
