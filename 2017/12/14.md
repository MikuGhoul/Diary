## Piping and Redirection

* Piping is for process
* Redirection is for file

#### stream
* Every program run on the command line automatically has three data streams connected to it
    * `stdin`
        * 0
        ``` shell
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l stdin
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Dec 14 17:26 stdin -> /proc/self/fd/0
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/0
        lrwx------ 1 mikughoul mikughoul 0 Dec 14 19:02 /proc/self/fd/0 -> /dev/tty1
        ```
    * `stdout`
        * 1
        ``` shell
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l stdout
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Dec 14 17:26 stdout -> /proc/self/fd/1
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/1
        lrwx------ 1 mikughoul mikughoul 0 Dec 14 19:03 /proc/self/fd/1 -> /dev/tty1
        ```
    * `stderr`
        * 2
        ```
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l stderr
        lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 15 Dec 14 17:26 stderr -> /proc/self/fd/2
        mikughoul@MikuGhoul-PC:/dev$ ls -l /proc/self/fd/2
        lrwx------ 1 mikughoul mikughoul 0 Dec 14 19:04 /proc/self/fd/2 -> /dev/tty1
        ```
* Piping and redirection is the means by which we may connect **these streams** between programs and files to **direct data**

#### Redirection
* **send data to and from files**
* redirection to a file
    * `>`/`1>`
    * if the redirect file which doesn't exit, it will be created automatically, and save the output
    * if the redirect file which already exit, it will clear the contents, and save the new output
        * if don't want to clear the old contents, use `>>`
* redirection from a file
    * `<`
* redirection stderr
    * `2>`
    * `stderr` is stream number 2
        * `>` default to stream number 1
* redirect stream
    * redirect `stderr` stream to `stdout` stream
    ``` shell
    ls exit.file notexit.file > out.file 2>&1
    ```
    * cancel the connect stream
    ``` shell
    ls notexit.file 2>&-
    ```
#### Piping
* **send data from one program to another programs**
* `|`
