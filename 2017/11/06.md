## C++ namespace

> Namespaces provide a method for preventing name conflicts in large projects

#### Defined/Redeclared 
* A namespace member that was **declared within** a namespace body may be **defined or redeclared outside** of it using explicit qualification

* Out of namespace definitions and redeclarations are only allowd **after the point of declaration, only at namespace scope, and only in namespaces that enclose the original namespaces**

#### Unnamed namespace
* This definition is treated as a definition of a namespace with **unique name** and a `using-directive` in the current scope that nominates this unnamed namespace
* uname namespace will upgrade to one level of scope

#### Using declarations
* Introduces a name that is defined elsewhere into the declarative region where this using-declaration appears

#### Using directives
* `using namespace <namespace-name>`
