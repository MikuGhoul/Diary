## Types of operating systems

#### Single- and multi- tasking
* A single-tasking system can only run one program at a time
* A multi-tasking operating system allows more than one program to be running in concurrency
    * achieved by time-sharing
* Multi-tasking may be characterized in **preemptive** and **co-operative** type

#### Single- and multi- user
* Single-user operating system have **no facilities to distinguish users**, but may allow multiple programs to run in tandem
* Multi-user operating system extends the basic concept of multi-tasking **with facilities that identify processes and resources**

#### Distributed operating system
* manages **a group of** distinct computers and makes them appear to be **a single** computer  

#### Templated
* distributed and cloud computing context, templating refers to creating a single virtual machine image as a guest operating system, then saving it as a tool for multiple running virtual machines

#### Embedded

#### Real-time operating
* Guarantees to process events or data by a specific moment in time

#### Library
* Services that a typeical operating system provides, such as networking
