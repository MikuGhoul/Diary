## Reverse Polish notation
* RPN
* Polish notation is often used in stack-oriented

* the operators follow their operands
    * infix expression `3 + 4`
    * `3 4 +`
* don't need expressions to be parenthesized
    * infix expression `(3 - 4) x 5`
    * RPN `3 4 - 5 x` or `5 3 4 - x`

#### Example
* `15 7 1 1 + − ÷ 3 × 2 1 1 + + −`

Token   | Type      | Stack     | Actions
------  | ------    | ------    | ------
15      | operand   | 15        | push onto stack
7       | operand   | 15 7      | push onto stack
1       | operand   | 15 7 1    | push onto stack
1       | operand   | 15 7 1 1  | push onto stack
+       | operator  | 15 7 2    | pop from stack twice (1, 1), calculate (1 + 1 = 2) and push onto stack
−       | operator  | 15 5      | pop from stack twice (7, 2), calculate (7 − 2 = 5) and push onto stack
÷       | operator  | 3         | pop from stack twice (15, 5), calculate (15 ÷ 5 = 3) and push onto stack
3       | operand   | 3 3       | push onto stack
×       | operator  | 9         | pop from stack twice (3, 3), calculate (3 × 3 = 9) and push onto stack
2       | operand   | 9 2       | push onto stack
1       | operand   | 9 2 1     | push onto stack
1       | operand   | 9 2 1 1   | push onto stack
+       | operator  | 9 2 2     | pop from stack twice (1, 1), calculate (1 + 1 = 2) and push onto stack
+       | operator  | 9 4       | pop from stack twice (2, 2), calculate (2 + 2 = 4) and push onto stack
-       | operator  | 5         | pop from stack twice (9, 4), calculate (9 − 4 = 5) and push onto stack
