## OS

* **System software** that manages computer hardware and software resources and providers common service for computer programs

#### Components 1
* Kernel
    * Program execution
        * Executing an application program involves the creation of a **process** by the operating system kernel which assigns memory space and other resources
    * Interrupts
        * Provide an efficient way for the operating system to interact with and react to ite environment
        * The alternative having the operating system "watch" the various sources of input for events that require action(**polling**)
    * Modes
        * Supervisor mode
            * operating allows **unrestricted** access to all machine resources
        * User mode
            * operating sets **limits** on instruction use and typically **disallow** direct access to machind resources
    * Memory management
        * For **multiprogramming** operating system, memory management ensure that a program doesn't interface with memory already in use by another program
    * Virtual memory
        * Provids the user with the preception that there is a **much larger amount of RAM** in the computer than is really there
    * Multitasking
        * Running of multiple independent computer programs on the **same computer**
        * Giving the apperence that it is performing the tasks at the **same time**
        * An operating system kernel contains a **scheduling program** which determines how much time each process spends executing, and in which order excuting control should be passed to programs
    * Disk access and file systems
        * Computers store data on disks using files
        * The specific way in which files are stored on a disk is called a **file system**, enables files to have names and attributes
        * Allow them to be stored in hierarchy of directories or folders arranged in a directory tree
    * Device drivers
        * A specific type of computer **software** developed to allow interaction with **hardware** devices
