    * V is a finite set; each element {\displaystyle v\in V} v\in V is called a nonterminal character or a variable. Each variable represents a different type of phrase or clause in the sentence. Variables are also sometimes called syntactic categories. Each variable defines a sub-language of the language defined by G.
    * Î£ is a finite set of terminals, disjoint from V, which make up the actual content of the sentence. The set of terminals is the alphabet of the language defined by the grammar G.
    * R is a finite relation from V to {\displaystyle (V\cup \Sigma )^{*}} (V\cup \Sigma )^{*}, where the asterisk represents the Kleene star operation. The members of R are called the (rewrite) rules or productions of the grammar. (also commonly symbolized by a P)
    * S is the start variable (or start symbol), used to represent the whole sentence (or program). It must be an element of V.
