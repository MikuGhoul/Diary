## OS

#### Components
* Networking
    * Most operating systems support a variety of networking protocols
    * Some network services allow the resources of a computer to be accessed transparently, such as SSH which allows networked users direct access to a computer's command line interface
    * Client/Server networking allows a program on a computer, called a client, to connect via a network to another computer, called a server
    * These services are usually provided through ports or numbered access points beyond the server's IP address
        * Each port number is usually associated with a maximum of one running program, which is responsible for hadling requests to that port
* Security
    * The operating system must be capable of distinguishing between requests which should be allowed to be processed, and others which should not be processed
    * Systems commonly have a form of requester identity, such as a user name.
* User interface
    * Graphical user interfaces
    * Command line
