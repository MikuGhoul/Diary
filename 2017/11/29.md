## Three way to install software in linux

#### apt/apt-get
* `apt/apt-get install` will download and install software from the **repositories** you currently have enabled
    * the repositories websites are located at `/etc/apt/sources.list`
#### dpkg
* dpkg -i is similar to `apt-get install` except that instead of looking for software **online**, it requires the **DEB package** you wish to install to already be located in an accessible location in the file system
* it can be removed via `apt-get`, just like a package that you used `apt-get` to install

#### sudo make install
* run make script to **compile** the source code
* need to make sure you have the **dependencies** for software when you're building it
* can't use `apt-ge`t or `dpkg` to uninstall programs installed via `sudo make install`
