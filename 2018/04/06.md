## fopen && open

#### fopen
* `FILE *fopen( const char *restrict filename, const char *restrict mode )`
* Manual page DESCRIPTION
    > The fopen() function opens the file whose name is the string pointed to by pathname and **associates a stream with it**
1. C library function
    * portable
2. buffered IO
3. **returns** a **stream** and you can call stream functions on it, like `fscanf, fprintf, or fread, fwrite`

#### open
* `int open(const char *pathname, int flags, mode_t mode)`
* Manual page DESCRIPTION
    > The open() function shall establish the **connection between a file and a file descriptor**
1. unix-like system call
    * not portable
2. non-buffered
3. **returns** an **file descriptor**, you can call IO functions with the `fd, like read, write`

* Generally fopen is **implemented** using open underline.
* Buffered IO may turn out to be a lot **faster** than non-buffered
